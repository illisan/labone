            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Self-starter, creative, focused. A Swiss-Ecuadorian living in Vancouver, BC. 
                I graduated with a BA in German and Sociology from the University of British Columbia in 2014. 
                Digital marketing is the result of my combined interest in people and technology. 
                I believe that people how people act in the real world is parallel to how they act online. 
                Story-telling and a positive user experience are the key drivers of customer advocacy. 
                I enjoy listening to other people's stories and learning from them, building personal and 
                long-lasting connections is something that comes naturally to me. I indulge in a healthy 
                lifestyle surrounded by interesting and inspiring people. My diverse experience working and 
                living aboard have provided me with the tools to thrive in a community-driven atmosphere and 
                my education has rooted a genuine and constant curiosity for learning and personal development. </p>
