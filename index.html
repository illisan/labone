            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Self-starter, creative, focused. A Swiss-Ecuadorian living in Vancouver, BC. I graduated with a BA in German
                and Sociology from the University of British Columbia in 2014. Digital marketing is the result of my combined
                interest in people and technology. I believe that people how people act in the real world is parallel to
                how they act online. Story-telling and a positive user experience are the key drivers of customer advocacy.
                I enjoy listening to other people's stories and learning from them, building personal and long-lasting connections
                is something that comes naturally to me. I indulge in a healthy lifestyle surrounded by interesting and inspiring
                people. My diverse experience working and living aboard have provided me with the tools to thrive in a community-driven
                atmosphere and my education has rooted a genuine and constant curiosity for learning and personal development.
